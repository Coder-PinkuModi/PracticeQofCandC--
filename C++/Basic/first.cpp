#include<iostream>// header file to print like using cin,cout,etc

using namespace std;/// using this we can avoid to write "std::" in front functions like cout,cin,vector,etc!! explanation given in the diary of DSA

int main(){
    std::cout<<"Hello Coder! WELCOME to C++\n ";
    cout<<"!!"<<endl<<"Start your coding journey"; // just to show that code will run efficiently without generating any error if std:: is not given before cout as we had used "using namespace std;" after header files
}
